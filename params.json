This is the recommended installation path.\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\nSimply checkout the git repo into “~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text [VERSION NUMBER]/Packages/ or the equivalent folder on Windows or Linux.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2/Packages/\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/benmatselby/sublime-phpcs.git Phpcs\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both cases, you may need to then configure the following with the actual path to the application:\r\n\r\n* “phpcs_php_path”\r\n* “phpcs_executable_path”\r\n* “phpmd_executable_path”\r\n* “php_cs_fixer_executable_path”\r\n\r\nThey are optional for the plugin. The path needs to include the application such as “/usr/local/bin/phpcs”.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the path of the application (On a Mac/Linux based environment), you can use:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ which phpcs\r\n$ which phpmd\r\n$ which php-cs-fixer\r\n$ which phpcbf\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n* Ability to run PHP_CodeSniffer\r\n* Ability to run php -l on the open file\r\n* Ability to run PHP Mess Detector on the open file\r\n* Ability to run Scheck on the open file\r\n* Show cached results from PHP_CodeSniffer in open file\r\n* Show errors in the Quick Panel\r\n* Show errors in the Gutter\r\n* Highlight the errors in the editor\r\n* Show the error for a given line in the status bar\r\n* Ability to specify the regular expression of the linter errors\r\n* Ability to specify the location of the PHP_CodeSniffer application\r\n* Ability to specify the location of the PHP Mess Detector application\r\n* Ability to run the PHP Coding Standards Fixer tool which fixes most issues in your code when you want to follow the PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1 and PSR-2 documents\r\n* Ability to run the PHP Code Beautifier tool which fixes most issues in your code when you want to follow PHP coding standards\r\n\r\nOnce you have right clicked on a file and selected “PHP CodeSniffer” > “Sniff this file…” you will get the output as shown below (depending on the settings you have defined):\r\n\r\n\r\n##Configuration\r\nYou can also define the configuration for the following settings, be it for a project, user settings or the default settings:\r\n\r\n###Plugin\r\n\r\n* show_debug – Do you want the debug information to be sent to the console?\r\n* extensions_to_execute – Which filetypes do you want the plugin to execute for?\r\n* extensions_to_blacklist – Override the extensions_to_execute in case you have a sub extension such as twig.php etc.\r\n* phpcs_execute_on_save – Do you want the code sniffer plugin to run on file save for php files?\r\n* phpcs_show_errors_on_save – Do you want the errors to be displayed in quick_panel on save?\r\n* phpcs_show_gutter_marks – Do you want the errors to be displayed in the gutter?\r\n* phpcs_outline_for_errors – Do you want the errors to be highlighted in the editor?\r\n* phpcs_show_errors_in_status – Do you want the errors to be displayed in status bar when clicking on the line with error?\r\n* phpcs_show_quick_panel – Do you want the errors to be displayed in the quick panel?\r\n* phpcs_php_prefix_path – Needed on windows for phar based applications.
